I have chosen a robotic arm project for the robotics club's summer project because I have keen interest in learning the functioning of Robots. Like what are the things which are required for movement and what are the codes and how they are implemented . I will also get to know different types of software involved in this project.Robots are used everywhere in all types of industries.
